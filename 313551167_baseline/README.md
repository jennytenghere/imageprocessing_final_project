# Baseline Implementations

This directory implements two baseline methods for photomosaic : 
- [Tran_mosaic_1999](./Tran_mosaic_1999/)
- [simulating_decorative_mosaics_2001](./simulating_decorative_mosaics_2001) 

Below are the descriptions of each method and the references to the papers they are based on.

## Tran_mosaic_1999
This implementation is based on the paper [Generating photomosaics: an empirical study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/298151.298213), focusing on the basic rectangular tile approach using L1 distance for tile matching. The code is modified on this reposity  https://github.com/codebox/mosaic

## simulating_decorative_mosaics_2001
This implementation is based on the paper [Simulating decorative mosaics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/383259.383327).
