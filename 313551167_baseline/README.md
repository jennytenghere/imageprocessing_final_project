# Baseline Implementations

This project implements three baseline methods for image processing: [Tran_mosaic](./Tran_mosaic_1999/), [github_codebox](./github_codebox_mosaic/), and [cut_out_image mosaic](./cut_out_image_mosaic_2008/) . Below are the descriptions of each method and the references to the papers they are based on.

## Tran_mosaic
This implementation is based on the paper [Generating photomosaics: an empirical study](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/298151.298213), focusing on the basic rectangular tile approach using L1 distance for tile matching.


## github_codebox
The github_codebox methodis based on the github https://github.com/codebox/mosaic

## cut_out_image mosaic
This implementation is based on the paper [Cut-Out Image Mosaics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1377980.1377997),
